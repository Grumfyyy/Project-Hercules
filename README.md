# Project Hercules

## Demo
[Android](https://github.com/Grumfyyy/Project-Hercules/releases/tag/apk)

## So what is Project Hercules?

Project Hercules is a crossplatform fitness application that helps track gym progress and food intake.
All progress is stored locally meaning i as a developer can't reach the daily progress.

## Why was it developed?

Tracking progress in the gym and in the kitchen with paper and pen is something i've seen and something i don't like to do when tracking my progress 
so therefor as software developer student, i wanted to test my ability to develop something from an issue to a solution.

## Further development on it

I would want to add cloud authentication and storing, with Google firebase, and from that data, add a graph visualisation page, to showcase the progress in the gym and in the kitchen over a timespan, i don't think adding the functionality of cloud auth and cloud storing is too big of a scope, but...

### Why am i not gonna develop this project further?

Since having cloud storing and authentication in a project, means sending valuable data, and having this github repo public with keys to a firebase project, would put the database at 
risk for spam and other issues i can't think of, therefor i don't think it's wise to implement and put it in the open for everyone to see.
